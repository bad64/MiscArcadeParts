# Caps for Kailh Choc v1 switches

... Really that's about it. They should fit in basically every Kailh Choc based slimbox out there.

Print them in PETG or TPU (to taste), or you know basically anything with good layer adhesion. If you can make them in polypropylene, go right ahead.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Don't print these in PLA ! PETG already breaks inside the switches permanently blocking them if mishandled; PLA does not have the layer adhesion required for this kind of application (especially if you repeatedly hit the edges of the cap)
