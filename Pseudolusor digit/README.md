# We have GamerFingers at home

Cheap riff on the elusive and grossly overpriced GamerFinger buttons. Heck, the name itself can be translated as "Pseudo GamerFingers".

Comes in MX (requires either soldering to the switch pins or an additional board) and SW68 CAU flavors. I don't have CAU2 to test if they fit. Feel free to mail me a dozen of those :]

You will need:
- A slicer
- Blender if you want to modify the model
- A Cherry MX style switch for the MX versions, or
- A Sanwa SW68 CAU switch for the SW68 versions

> [!NOTE]
>
> Not all MX clones work (Gaterons for example won't fit in the 24mm barrels). Exercise caution.

Recommended print settings:
- Material: PETG, maybe TPU for the plunger. PLA might work depending on the exact filament
- Infill: 20% gyroid
- Supports: Yes (body), No (plunger & nut)
