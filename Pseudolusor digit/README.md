# We have GamerFingers at home

Cheap riff on the elusive and grossly overpriced GamerFinger buttons. Heck, the name itself can be translated as "Pseudo GamerFingers".

Comes in MX (requires either soldering to the switch pins or an additional board) and SW68 CAU flavors. I don't have CAU2 to test if they fit. Feel free to mail me a dozen of those :]

PETG recommended, 20-30% infill. Print as hot as your filament can handle to maximize layer bonding.
